Adaptive News Verification & Refinement API
Overview
This API processes news articles by first tailoring the content based on reader type (IT or Business) and proficiency level (Enthusiast, Bachelor, Master), and then verifying key numerical claims via external sources. It leverages a configurable LLM (initially Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) for text processing and query generation, and integrates a web-scraping tool (crawl4ai) to retrieve external evidence for cross-checking.

Key Functionalities
Input & Content Ingestion

Multi-format Input: Accept inputs as a URL link, plain text, or a JSON file containing the news article.
Parsing & Preprocessing: Standardize and parse the input, extract key sections, and prepare for analysis.
Audience-Based Content Filtering

Tailored Refinement: Use the LLM to modify the news text according to:
Reader Type: IT or Business focus.
Proficiency Level: Enthusiast, Bachelor, or Master.
Content Simplification/Enhancement: Adjust technical depth, language style, and context based on the target reader profile.
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for Data Verification

Query Generation:
Utilize the LLM to create search queries based on the topic—but intentionally omit explicit numerical details to retrieve unbiased sources.
Generate two distinct queries to fetch the top relevant search results.
Search Requests:
Integrate with a Google search API (or alternative search service) to retrieve links corresponding to the generated queries.
Web Data Retrieval:
Leverage crawl4ai to scrape and save the content from the top two search results as Markdown.
Numerical Data Comparison & Analysis

Extraction of Numerical Data: Identify key numerical values (e.g., pricing, statistics) from the original news article.
Cross-checking:
Use the scraped data from external sources to verify if the numbers are consistent.
Apply the LLM to compare the figures, flag discrepancies, or confirm the legitimacy.
Result Analysis: Based on the comparison, determine if the news data appears:
Legitimate (verified),
False/inaccurate, or
Unverified (insufficient external confirmation).
Output Generation

Integrated News Refinement: Produce a final version of the news article that includes:
The refined text tailored to the user’s profile.
A conclusion or summary section outlining the verification outcome.
API Response: Deliver a structured JSON output including both the refined content and the verification report.
Configurability & Extensibility

Model Agnostic Design: Allow easy swapping of the underlying LLM (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct can be replaced with another model as needed).
Modular Components: Each functionality (input parsing, content filtering, query generation, scraping, numerical comparison) is implemented as a separate module for easier maintenance and scalability.
Proposed Development Plan
Phase 1: Planning & Design
Requirements Analysis: Finalize all user stories and technical requirements.
Architecture Design: Define overall system architecture, including:
API gateway and RESTful endpoints.
Modular design for each functional component.
Data flow between filtering, RAG process, and output generation.
Technology Stack Decisions:
Primary LLM model (with flexibility for future changes).
Integration of crawl4ai for web scraping.
Google Search API or an alternative for retrieving external links.
Phase 2: Implementation
Module 1: Input & Preprocessing
Develop parsers for link, text, and JSON inputs.
Implement basic validation and error handling.
Module 2: Content Filtering
Build LLM interface for audience-based refinement.
Create prompt templates specific to IT vs. Business and different proficiency levels.
Module 3: Query Generation & RAG Integration
Develop LLM prompts to generate unbiased search queries.
Integrate with a search API to fetch top two links.
Module 4: Web Scraping & Data Storage
Set up crawl4ai integration to retrieve and convert webpages to Markdown.
Ensure proper storage and formatting of scraped data.
Module 5: Numerical Data Extraction & Comparison
Implement algorithms (or LLM prompts) to extract numerical data from both the news article and scraped content.
Design logic for comparing figures and determining data validity.
Module 6: Output Generation
Combine refined content with verification results.
Generate a comprehensive JSON response.
Phase 3: Testing & Validation
Unit Testing: Test individual modules (e.g., input parsing, LLM responses, scraping).
Integration Testing: Ensure seamless data flow between modules.
User Testing: Validate the tailored output for different reader profiles and verify the accuracy of numerical comparisons.
Performance Testing: Assess response times, especially for the RAG process and web scraping.
Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation
API Deployment:
Deploy the API on a suitable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP).
Implement necessary monitoring, logging, and rate-limiting.
Documentation:
Create comprehensive API documentation and user guides.
Include developer documentation for maintaining and extending the project.
Post-Deployment Monitoring:
Set up feedback loops and performance monitoring to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.
Additional Considerations
Error Handling & Fallbacks: Implement robust error handling in cases where external sources fail or return inconsistent data.
Security & Compliance: Ensure that all data processing complies with relevant data protection regulations.
Scalability: Design the API with scalability in mind to handle increased load and multiple concurrent requests.
User Feedback Loop: Optionally, incorporate a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the verification accuracy, which can help fine-tune the model prompts and overall system performance.
